      "I have opted for the handwritten medical sick leave certificate and shipment. After the form filling process, I got a confirmation call the next moment. In no time, I got a next call from the doctor herself asking about symptoms and condition. Within 45 min overall, they sent me my certificate. Overall, the experience was great and I would recommend it to everyone.",
